DialogFlow tutorial FREE ebook
For my students, I’ve created a FREE ebook about DialogFlow.

In it, we cover all the DialogFlow building blocks, from intents, entities, contexts to reading parameters from a conversation and saving it to a database. 
We work on examples, and in the process, I show you tips and tricks.

Book has over 200 pages of content. It will take you from beginner to master. You can get it by talking to my Messenger bot.
