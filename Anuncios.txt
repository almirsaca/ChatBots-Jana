Changes with Fb Messenger & more reviews

Hi,

Facebook is changing fast. One of the changes was in the subscription right for sending messages outside the 24h scope. Facebook is becoming more and more strict.

Only Pages that are registered with the Facebook News Page Index (NPI) will be allowed to send non-promotional news messages.

You can read more about it here:

I'll update the videos for this course ASAP.



I’ve got another review from you from the great Udemy instructor. The course is Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms from Andrei Neagoie.

Right now, there is a SALE on Udemy, and you can get the course for only 11.99. Sale ends Oct. 3.

Don’t forget to subscribe to my channel if you have not done it yet:)

Here is the link to the YouTube review:

Master the Coding Interview is teaching you how to write readable, scalable code.

You will master how to efficiently work with data structures like arrays, hash tables, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

You’ll understand recursion, and you’ll be familiar with sorting algorithms, searching, and dynamic programming. Andrei also takes you through the common non-technical questions that you can get on an interview.

In this video, I’ll tell you what I like about the course and what I don’t. All the goods and all the bad so you can decide if this course is for you.

We’ll review the course content, the teacher presentation, and the applicability of the course. In short, will this course really help you get a job?
